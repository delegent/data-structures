Generic Methods
The method that can refer to any data type are called Generic Methods.
for example - 
void swap(int x, int y){
	int temp = x;
	x = y;
	y  temp;
}
problem is that it is restricted for the integer dta type only and for swapping the 
values whose data type is Something like String, or double or etc.. then there will 
must be a problem and that wil evacuate the DRY principle of coding.
Hence we have to make the things generic;

Syntax:
<access specifier> <return type> MethodName(<type list>){
	// body of method.	
}

for creating the variable length arguments or vargs
there can be several ways

using elipsis and arrays - this will enable us the property of applying for providign the predefined data type.
and using Object and elipsis -> this will enable us to povide any kind of data we 
want
